<div align="center"><h2>What is this?</h2></div>
Lapsus is an application designed to emulate the feeling of using a trackball. It applies "momentum" to your cursor so that it glides (or slides) across the screen until slowly coming to a stop. Lapsus was born out of Magnes, which was an application designed to emulate the iPadOS cursor as a whole.
